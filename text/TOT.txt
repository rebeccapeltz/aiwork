Multiple Strategies to Get to a Decision
You are the marketing director for a new sustainable coffee brand. 
Your primary objective is to increase online sales by 25% in the next quarter. 
Develop three distinct marketing strategies to achieve this goal. 
For each strategy, outline its core mechanism (e.g., social media campaign, influencer partnership, SEO push), list the primary required resources, and identify a major potential risk. 
After presenting all three strategies, conclude by recommending the single best strategy and provide a brief justification for your choice.
